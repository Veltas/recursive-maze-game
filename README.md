recursive-maze-game
===================

A maze game with difficult mazes that can be solved easier with other mazes with the same rules.  Hilarity ensues.

Target Platform:
Windows XP SP3+

Will be a learning exercise in writing a project on GitHub and how to use the API provided by MS to draw basic graphics.

The game may be fun too, we'll see.
