recursive-maze-game
===================

Can compile for Windows XP SP3+.

Rubbishy maze game I wrote half-sleep-deprived for my first 48 hour Warwick
Game Design jam. I decided I wanted to write something for my XP laptop and I
decided to try doing it with GDI+, a Microsoft technology. What a big mistake
that was: GDI+ isn't at all designed to draw games, it would perhaps be
appropriate for drawing basic graphics in an application on demand.

In my defence:

- I started part of the way through very tired, and then tried to stay for the whole thing which was a stupid mistake.

- I was clearly suffering from some kind of mental problem at the time because I made a concious decision to write it in win32.

- About 95% of the problems with this I'm fully aware of and this is at least a nice project for me to refactor like crazy at some point.
