BUG:
	Title in main window appears in jibberish chinese.
WHY:
	String was being stored as ASCII, UNICODE hadn't been defined where it was being saved, predefs.hpp contained UNICODE macro definition for the project.

BUG:
	White window until forcing paint and then black window.
WHY:
	Clearly the responce to WM_PAINT message is malfunctioning.
